## Introduction

The Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance and Auto Parking Car project aims to create a car that can navigate around obstacles and park itself without human intervention. The project combines hardware components, embedded systems, and software algorithms to achieve autonomous navigation and parking.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance-and-Auto-Parking-Car.git
   cd Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance-and-Auto-Parking-Car
Set Up the Hardware: Follow the hardware setup instructions provided in the Embedded presentation.pptx and Diagram.jpg.

Install Required Software: Install the necessary software and libraries to program the embedded system. Refer to the code.ino file for the list of required libraries.

Usage
Program the Embedded System:

Open the code.ino file in your preferred Arduino IDE.
Compile and upload the code to the microcontroller.
Run the System:

Power on the system and observe the car navigating and parking autonomously.
Adjust the parameters in the code if needed to improve performance.
